## 🎮 Gaming Platform Integration Module

### 🎯 Purpose
Extend the value of textile NFTs by allowing them to be used as **skins or decorative elements** in compatible video games.

### 🧩 Features
This module lets designers publish **game-adapted versions** of their textile NFTs to be used as:

- Character skins
- Clothing or armor textures
- Decorative environmental items (tapestries, walls, props)
- Cosmetic, swappable game items

### 🔗 Integration with external platforms
- Support for 3D and texture formats (GLTF, UV-mapped PNGs, etc.)
- Public API to allow games to query and render assets linked to NFTs
- Each game asset is linked to the original NFT and inherits its licensing rules

### 💰 Additional Monetization
- Designers can create **"gaming editions"** of their NFTs with specific usage rights.
- These can be sold within Design Guardian or exported to external NFT marketplaces.
- In-game purchases or usage automatically trigger on-chain royalty mechanisms.
